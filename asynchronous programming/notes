Asynchronous Programming
Objectives

Describe the workings of an Asynchronous operation
Use callback to handle async operation
Demonstrate callback and event loops
Implement promises to handle async operations
Rewrite async code with callbacks using promises
Refactor your legacy code using async and await functions

the asynchronous (later abbreviated as async) nature of JavaScript. 

The focus will be on how conventional languages handle operations that take time to complete, and how JavaScript handles these operations.
